# Backstory/Reasoning
In 2018, I created a website for my family's business. I had to learn web development from a bootcamp course I took on Udemy and was able to create the website using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and PHP. I learned how to use AWS in order to host this website and I got it up and running. It did not look the greatest, but it worked!

Fast forward to 2021 where I gained in interest in learning React and Node and thought what better way to practice my skills than to recreate this website from scratch. Now that I have a little more experience on what tech stacks are, I have decided to use the MERN stack in order to recreate this project.

## Technology learned/used
- For the front end I decided to use the React JS framework because of its popularity. It was fairly easy to learn and pickup and would definitely see myself creating more projects with this framework.
- For the backend, I finally decided to take up Javascript as the main language. I learned how Node.js worked and how it is a great tool for JS backend development. In order for my backend to communicate with my frontend, I then used Express in order to create a server that would handle all the requests. Finally, I wanted to store all the forms that were submitted, so I learned and used Mongo, a NoSQL db, for the main database.

## Takeaway
I really enjoyed using this stack for development. As someone who has created web applications with PHP and Python, I can say that the MERN stack has been by far the most fun and interesting to learn.
